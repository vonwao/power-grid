# Backup of Removed Files

This directory contains files that were removed from the main codebase as part of the cleanup process.

## Files

1. `components/UnifiedToolbarDataGridDemo.tsx`
   - Removed on: April 2, 2025
   - Reason: This component was only used in the unified-toolbar.tsx page, which has been updated to use EnhancedDataGridDemo instead.
   - The component was likely a prototype or experimental version that was superseded by EnhancedDataGridDemo.

2. `components/DataGridToolbar.tsx`
   - Removed on: April 2, 2025
   - Reason: This component was imported in EnhancedDataGridDemo.tsx but never actually used.
   - It has been replaced by UnifiedDataGridToolbar which is used in the EnhancedDataGrid component.

## Restoration

If you need to restore these files, you can copy them back to their original locations:

```bash
cp backup/components/UnifiedToolbarDataGridDemo.tsx components/
cp backup/components/DataGridToolbar.tsx components/
```

However, you may need to update imports and references to make them work with the current codebase.
