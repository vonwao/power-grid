# Enhanced Data Grid Implementation

## Accomplishments

1. **Created a Master Hook Architecture**
   - Implemented `useEnhancedDataGrid` hook that composes functionality from other hooks
   - Added support for conditional loading with `onlyLoadWithFilters` prop
   - Implemented enhanced column menu options

2. **Developed New UI Components**
   - Created `EmptyStateOverlay` for conditional loading UI
   - Implemented `GridToolbar` with dynamic mode-based actions
   - Ensured backward compatibility with existing code

3. **Implemented Main Component**
   - Created `EnhancedDataGrid` component with a clean, unified API
   - Maintained backward compatibility by aliasing to `EnhancedDataGridGraphQL`
   - Added proper TypeScript types and interfaces

4. **Added Comprehensive Tests**
   - Created tests for `useEnhancedDataGrid` hook
   - Set up testing infrastructure with Jest and React Testing Library
   - Fixed Jest configuration for proper TypeScript support

5. **Updated MTM Adjustments Page**
   - Integrated the new component with conditional loading
   - Added custom toolbar actions

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Testing**
   - Fix remaining tests for UI components
   - Add integration tests with real data

2. **Documentation**
   - Create comprehensive API documentation
   - Add usage examples for different scenarios

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Profile and optimize rendering performance
   - Implement virtualization for large datasets

4. **Feature Enhancements**
   - Add support for custom cell renderers
   - Implement advanced filtering capabilities
   - Add export functionality

5. **Migration Plan**
   - Update all pages using the old component
   - Create migration guide for developers

## Technical Debt Addressed

- Consolidated scattered functionality into a single hook
- Improved type safety with proper TypeScript definitions
- Fixed testing infrastructure issues
- Standardized component API

This implementation provides a solid foundation for future enhancements while maintaining backward compatibility with existing code.
